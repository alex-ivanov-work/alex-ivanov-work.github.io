Data Requests – Verification Information NeededWhether you’re making a data request under GDPR (Section 5) or CCPA (Section 6), we will need certain information in order to verify your identity and process a data request. Please provide your unique Advertising IDs for any device you’re using to play the game, along with the device type (Android or iOS) associated with each Advertising ID.&nbsp;You can find this as follows:iOS: Currently, you can only access your Advertising ID on an iOS device by using a third party application. On your device, the ID will be called an “Identifier for Advertisers” or “IDFA”. There are a number of apps which perform this function on the App Store, but some common ones are:AppsFlyer’s “My Device IDFA” - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-device-id-by-appsflyer-whitelist-test-device/id1192323960" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-18">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-device-id-by-appsflyer-whitelist-test-device/id1192323960</a>Adjust’s “Adjust Insights” - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adjust-insights/id1125517808" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-19">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adjust-insights/id1125517808</a>TUNE’s “My TUNE Device” - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-tune-device/id1100377074" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-20">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-tune-device/id1100377074</a>
          <br>Android: On Android, your Advertising ID is known as the “Android Advertising Identifier” or the “Google Advertising ID.” On most Android devices, you can find this AAI/GAID in the Settings app on your device, under “Google”, then under “Ads.” It will be listed on the bottom of the screen. However, depending on your device, the specific location may vary. Please consult your device manufacturer for specific instructions on finding the AAI/GAID. Alternatively, you can download an application to access your AAI/GAID, such as AppsFlyer's "My Device ID" app: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appsflyer.android.deviceid" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-21">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appsflyer.android.deviceid</a>&nbsp;<br>
          <br>7. Keeping your Personal Information secureWe have taken steps to put appropriate security measures in place to prevent personal information from being accidentally lost, or used or accessed in an unauthorized way.&nbsp;For example, we limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorized manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.We use SSL encryption and other technologies to keep data safe when we transfer and store it.<br>
          <br>8. How to complainWe hope that we can resolve any questions or concerns you raise about our use of your Personal Information. Please contact us via the methods listed below in the section entitled “How to contact us” to let us know about any of your questions or concerns, and we will get back to you to resolve the issue.If you are an EU citizen, the General Data Protection Regulation also gives you right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the European Union (or European Economic Area) state where you work, normally live, or where any alleged infringement of data protection laws occurred.&nbsp;<br>
